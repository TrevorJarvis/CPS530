# Conclusion

## ExpressJS

- Overall, we had a good experience using ExpressJS as our choice of backend.

- The framework meets our expectation.
  - It is a versatile and flexible framework.
  - Middlewares can used to add a lot of functionality to the server (e.g. logging, http body parser, etc.).

- It is easy to serve webpages with ExpressJS.
  - ExpressJS can serve static HTML/CSS/Javascript webpages on request.
  - It can also use template engines such as Pug to dynamically render static templates.

- The learning curve with ExpressJS is can be a bit steep.
  - It is easy to get started with NodeJS since it is just Javascript.
  - It is also easy to serve static HTML/CSS/Javascript.
  - However, it requires more understanding to take advantage of ExpressJS' middleware extension.

- In retrospect, we would spend more time to learn and take full advantage of extending ExpressJS capabilities with middlewares.

- We don't regret our choice of using ExpressJS as our back-end framework.
